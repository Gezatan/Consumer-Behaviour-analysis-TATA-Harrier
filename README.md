 Consumer Insights Across Purchase Stages: Tata Harrier Case Study

This project showcases my ability to perform in-depth consumer behavior analysis using a combination of primary research, statistical tools (SPSS), and theoretical frameworks to map consumer insights across all three purchase stages — Pre-Purchase, Purchase, and Post-Purchase — in the context of the Tata Harrier SUV.


# Objectives
	•	Understand what drives SUV interest among young professionals (MBA students).
	•	Identify the key purchase drivers and trade-offs made by consumers.
	•	Measure post-purchase satisfaction, cognitive dissonance, and word-of-mouth behavior.
	•	Use quantitative (survey, regression, correlation) and qualitative (focus group) data to validate insights.

# Research Approach
	•	Sample Size: 25 respondents (MBA students & professionals)
	•	Methodologies:
	•	Online surveys
	•	Focus group discussions
	•	Correlation analysis
	•	Multiple linear regression
	•	Tools Used: SPSS, Excel

# Purchase Stages & Insights

# Pre-Purchase Stage
	•	Key Drivers: Weekend trips, growing family needs, business use
	•	Top Information Sources: YouTube reviews, automobile blogs (more trusted than dealerships or TV ads)
	•	Brands Considered for Test Drive: Tata and Toyota lead over MG and Kia
	•	Insight: Tata enjoys brand loyalty, but must capitalize with stronger digital-first marketing for younger audiences

# Purchase Stage
	•	Statistical Analysis:
	•	Correlation showed younger buyers prioritize performance and price, while older consumers prefer comfort and safety
	•	Regression Analysis revealed top drivers of satisfaction:
	•	Fuel Efficiency (+1.31 effect on satisfaction)
	•	Price (+0.91)
	•	Brand Reputation (+0.75)
	•	Frameworks Applied:
	•	Multi-Attribute Attitude Model
	•	Compensatory & Non-Compensatory Decision Rules
	•	Theory of Planned Behavior

# Post-Purchase Stage
	•	Findings:
	•	Most users are satisfied with the Tata Harrier.
	•	Cognitive Dissonance is minimal and does not significantly affect word-of-mouth recommendations.
	•	NPS Score: 15% — Indicates moderate loyalty with strong recommendation intent.
	•	Marketing Insight: Positive WOM can be amplified by addressing minor quality issues and leveraging brand trust.

# Key Takeaways
	•	Data-backed insights across all purchase stages
	•	Application of marketing theories to real-world automotive purchase decisions
	•	Clear recommendations for Tata Motors to refine their positioning, messaging, and customer engagement strategy
